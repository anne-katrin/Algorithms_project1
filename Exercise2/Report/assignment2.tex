\section{Explanation of the Algorithm} 
 \noindent The problem which needs to be solved is as follows: there are a number of objects, which all have a size and a value, and we have a knapsack which has a capacity. This means that it only can take a certain amount of objects. These objects should amount to a value that is as large as possible.\\

  \caption{An illustration of the Knapsack problem! \citep{wikipic} }
\end{figure}



\textbf{Definitions:} The number of objects that are in the input file are defined as n, and the capacity of the Knapsack is defined as W.\\

\noindent \textbf{Pseudocode:}
\begin{tabbing}
For \= all the objects in the input file \\
\> fill an \= n by W matrix	\\
\> select the objects that give the highest value and fit into the Knapsack\\
\end{tabbing}

After reading the input file and putting each of these objects into a Tuple which has a weight and a value, the algorithm consists of two parts. First of all, the algorithm fills a matrix (which is going to be a two dimensional array) with the best values the first n tuples can give, which is less than or equal to W. Secondly, it traces which tuples (based on the matrix) gives the highest value and has a weight less than or equal to the capacity of the knapsack. \\ 
 

\section{Algorithm in Pseudocode}

\subsection{Reccurance}
The reccurance used for finding the best value is defined below. \citep{Tardos}

$OPT(i,w)$= \Bigg\{ \begin{tabular}{ll} 
0 & if $i$ = 0 \\
$OPT(i-1, w)$ & if $w_i > w$ \\
max \{$OPT(i-1, w), v_i + OPT(i-1, w-w_i )$\} & otherwise\\
\end{tabular}

The first row is the base case, if $i$ is equal to zero the recursion returns. Then there is a check to see if $w_i$ is greater then capacity, if so it skips object $i$ and continues. The last row takes the max of not taking the element versus taking the element. 

\subsection{Pseudocode for finding best value}
In this chapter the algorithm will be explained in more detail. The following is the pseudocode for filling the matrix. \newline

\begin{lstlisting}

n = size of the input list
W = capacity of the Knapsack
w1,...,wN = weights of objects in input list
v1,...,vN = values of objects in input list

for w = 0 to W loop
	M[0, w] = 0
end for

for j = 1 to n loop
	M[j, 0] = 0
end for

for i = 1 to n loop
	for w = 1 to W
		if (wi > w)
			M[i, w] = M[i-1, w]
		else
			M[i, w] = max {M[i-1, w], vi + M[i-1, w-wi]}
		end if
end for

return M[n, W]

\end{lstlisting}


\noindent This function fills the matrix ... more description \\ \\ 

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{unmarked_matrix.png}
  \caption{An example of a filled in matrix}
\end{figure}


The second part of the algorithm is to trace the tuples that give the highest value and have a weight less than or equal to the capacity of the knapsack. This pseudocode represents the function printBestSet(). \\ 

\begin{lstlisting}
n = size of the input list containing all the tuples
w = the size of the Knapsack 

for i is n to 1 loop
	if (array[i][weight] is equal to array[i-1][weight])
		do nothing;
	
	else
		w = w - the weight of the object i-1 in the input list
		print the tuples
	end if 
	
end for
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent In this part of the algorithm the solution of the problem is reconstructed. This is done by tracing back and comparing the wights of tuples in the matrix. The back tracing starts at the last entry of the matrix (i is n \&\& w is the size of the Knapsack)  ... MORE\\

\section{Correctness Justification}

The correctness of the algorithm is justified in two seperate sections, one for each part of the algorithm. For this the course litterature has been used for viewing examples of proofs \citep{Tardos}.

\subsection{Create powerset}
For the set $S = \{a,b,c\}$ a correct power set for S is $P = \{\{\},\{a\},\{b\},\{c\},\{a,b\},\{a,c\},\{b,c\},\{a,b,c\}$.

The createPowerset part of the algorithm has to make sure that each of the subsets in set $P$ are created. 

To do this, $n$ is defined as the number of elements in set $S$. In an execution of the algorithm the elements in $S$ would consist of tuples with a weight and size but here the tuples are represented by label $a,b$ and $c$.

The power set will have $2^n$ subset as shown in set $P$.\\\\

\textbf{Proof by contradiction}

Assume that the createPowerset part of the algoritm does not produce set $P$ when given the input of set $S$.

Letting the binary code for $i = 0$ to $2^n-1$ represent each possible subset, where a one in the binary code of $i$ means that the element from set $S$ at the place where the one is placed will be included and a zero means the element will not be included. For example, when $i = 5$ the binary code is 101 and the algorithm would include element $a$ and $c$ from the set $S$. By letting $element$ represent the placement of the element in set $S$ and setting $element = 1$, using a ''bitwise and'' compairison between $i$ \& $element$ where the result is $\neq0$ the element from set $S$ at place $element$ would be included in the subset. Since the algorithm for each $i$ iterates $n$ times, shifting the bit set to one in $element$ one step to the left compairing each binary code of $i = 0$ to $2^n-1$ with each element in set $S$ (represented by $elements$). Each possible subset will be created. A contradiction to our original assumption.

\subsection{Select best set}

\textbf{Proof by contradiction}

Assume that the selectBestSet does not select the best value among the subsets that fit in the knapsack.

Let $i = 0$ loop to $n$ where $n$ is the size of the subsetList and $j = 0$ loop through every object/Tuple in each subset $i$. For each object in a subset $i$ the algorithm stores the sum of the sizes and the sum of the values. It then compares if the size is $<=$ to the capacity, if so, the set would fit in the knapsack. When $i = 0$ it stores the first result of the values in $bestValue$ provided that the subset fit in the knapsack and at which position in the subsetList this subset $i$ was located. In the following iterations from $i$ to $n$ it only stores a new $bestValue$ (and where that set was located) if a better value was obtained until all subsets have been tested. This contradicts the assumption and when the algorithm has finished executing it has selected the first, if more than one, subset which fits in the knapsack and gives the highest possible value.

\section{Complexity Analysis}

The sums of the complexity of the knapsack problem are set up individually for the create power set and the select best set parts of the algorithms and are then calculated by adding them togheter.

\textbf{Elementary operation} is the same for the two parts of the algorithm. Assignment, if statements, adding elements to the end of arraylist and lookup in an arraylist are seen as elementary operations. In the pseudocode below for the two parts the number to the left indicate the complexity for each line of code.

\subsection{Create Power set}

\begin{lstlisting}
1			n = Size of the tuple list (input)
1			m = Size of possible subsets 2^n


2^n			for i = 0 to m-1 loop	
1				element = 1	
1				create temporary arraylist
	  
n				for j = 0 to n-1 loop	
1					if (i "bitwise and" element is not 0)
1						add tuple to temporary arraylist
				  end if
1					element = element << 1
			  end for\begin{align}
	
1			add subset to list
			end for
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{equation}
\sum^{2^n}_{i =1}3\sum^n_{j=1}3%= 
%\sum^{2^n}_{i =1}3(n-1+3) = 
%\sum^{2^n}_{i =1}3(n+2) = 
%(2^n-1+3)*(n+2) \in O(2n^n)
\end{equation}


\subsection{Select best set}

\begin{lstlisting}
1			k = Size of list containing all possible subsets
1			capacity = the capacity of the knapsack
1			bestValue = the best value of all subsets (intiated to 0)
1			bestSet = the set that gives bestValue

2^n			for i = 1 to k loop

1				sumSizes = 0
1				sumValue = 0

<=n				for j = 1 to size of subset i loop
1					store tuple j from subset i in tuple t
1					add the size of the tuple t to sumSizes and store in sumSizes
1					add the value of the tuple t to sumValue and store in sumValue
			  end for

1				if (sumSizes is less than or equal to the capacity)
1					if(sumValue is greater than bestValue)
1						store sumValue as bestValue
1						store set i as bestSet
					end if
				end if
			end for
\end{lstlisting}


\begin{equation}
\sum^{2^n}_{i=1}(6)\sum^n_{j=1}(3)
\end{equation}

\subsection{Complexity of knapsack exhaustive search}

The calculation below is the sum of the set up of the create power set function and the select best set function.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\sum^{2^n}_{i =1}3\sum^n_{j=1}3+\sum^{2^n}_{k=1}(6)\sum^n_{l=1}(3)= \\
\sum^{2^n}_{i =1}3(n-1+3) + \sum^{2^n}_{k =1}6(n-1+3) =  \\
\sum^{2^n}_{i =1}3(n+2) + \sum^{2^n}_{k =1}6(n+2) = \\
(2^n-1+3)*(n+2) + (2^n-1+6)*(n+2) = \\
(2^n+2)*(n+2) + (2^n+5)*(n+2) \in O(2^n*n)
\end{split}
\end{equation}

The result gives an upper bound by $O(2^n*n)$



\section{Performance Test}

The time for each test is measured in milliseconds. The tests were done by using java.lang.System.currentTimeMillis() to get one start time as the first thing done in the createPowerset method in the algorithm, and one stop time at the second last line (before calling the printBestSet method) in selectBestSet. The resulting execution time was calculated by subtrackting the the start time from the stop time to get a result of how long the algorithm was executing with the different input files.\\

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|} \hline
Items &Capacity &Execution time\\ \hline
\multirow{3}{*}{10} & 6 & 11 \\
& 20 & 11 \\
& 35 & 10 \\ \hline
\multirow{3}{*}{15} & 6 & 57 \\
& 20 & 61 \\
& 35 & 59 \\ \hline
\multirow{3}{*}{20} & 6 & 1460 \\
& 20 & 1447 \\
& 35 & 1445 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
